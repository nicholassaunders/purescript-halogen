## Profunctor example

This example uses a [```ProComponent```](https://github.com/therealnicksaunders/purescript-halogen/blob/master/src/Halogen/Component/Profunctor.purs#L11) wrapper to map the input and output of a component to different types.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-components
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/profunctor/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
